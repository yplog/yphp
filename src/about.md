  worked in various freelance jobs. I'm a big fan of Free and open-source
  software and I try to develop and contribute to open source projects when
  I can. I have been a member of FSF since 2015 and in the same years I became the founder of Perl Mongers Ankara. In addition to my expertise in JavaScript and TypeScript, I also have hands-on experience with Ruby on Rails, Go, Flutter and React Native.
