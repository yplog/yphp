# I’m Yalın. 
## I live in Ankara, Turkey.

I'm a software developer with a passion for building things.
I'm currently working at Netta Tech as a software developer.

I improved myself with the help of various courses and curiosity. I have
worked in various freelance jobs. I'm a big fan of Free and open-source
software and I try to develop and contribute to open source projects when
I can. I have been a member of FSF since 2015 and in the same years I became the founder of Perl Mongers Ankara. In addition to my expertise in JavaScript and TypeScript, I also have hands-on experience with Ruby on Rails, Go, Flutter and React Native.

I'm also a big fan of role-playing games, I love playing indie games and
even developing games whenever I can. I like to read comics and I have a
collection, even if it's not a big one.

So what am I doing [now](/now)?

If they are not enough please ask via any of the other contact methods
first.
