        ). I was born in 1994. Iâ€™m a software developer living in Ankara,
        Turkey. Iâ€™m full of wonder and infinitely skeptical toward authority.
        Iâ€™ve graduated from the department of metallurgy and materials
        engineering. I can say Paul Grahamâ€™s book Hackers and Painters as the
        turning point in my life.

        . I improved myself as a software developer with the help of various
        courses and curiosity. I have worked in various freelance jobs.
        Sometimes it continues. I have been a member of FSF

        . I contribute to open source projects. I worked at a startup company
        for about a year and I sailed to the new world with the withdrawal of
        the investor. Then I worked at NYKS Software
