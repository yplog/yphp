        Turkey. Iâ€™m full of wonder and infinitely skeptical toward authority. I've

        curiosity. Iâ€™ve been programming for about seven years. I
        have worked in various freelance jobs. Sometimes it continues. I have
        been an FSF member since 2015. I contribute to open source projects. I
        worked at a startup company for about a year and I sailed to the new world with
        the withdrawal of the investor. Then I worked at NYKS Software
